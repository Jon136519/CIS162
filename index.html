   My name is Jonathan Gonzalez and I am a student at Cerritos College. I am currently trying to get a degree in Computer Science and Administration of Justice. Dogs are a good pet in my opinion but now I'm a bird owner. My first laptop was a Mac and my first phone was a flip phone. I have grown up with technology so I want to have a career in it.
